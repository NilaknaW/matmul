1. implement Strassen's for 2x2 matrix multiplication. 
2. create addition and substraction units.
3. use 7 of the above matmul units and 18 addition units to implement 4x4 mat mul.
4. optimize integer/fixed-point mulitplications with Karatsuba.

## RTL Implementation in System Verilog
### Completed
2x2 matrix addition and substraction modules - combinational
2x2 matrix multiplication using Strassen's algorithm - FSM

### In-progress
4x4 matrix multiplier extending Strassen's algorithm. 

### To Do
IMplement Karatsuba multiplication to improve individual multiplications.
